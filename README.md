# Simplest-I2C-library-ever-for-ESP32-
I2C master library for ESP32 optimized for MAXIMUM transparency, readability, ease of use, integration and modification. Full spoonfeeding-grade documentation is included. 
Part of "Simple Universal Solutions" (SUS) library pack.

One .h file. No 3rd party #defines, #includes, typedefs and such. Because you have the right to use the code without the burden of learning the intricacies of author's code abstraction philosophy.

Two versions of the same library are available:
  "BAREBONES Version" - Just the core functions and bare minimum of documentation. For when you just want to copy-paste.
  "FULL version" - All the functions (core+extra), full spoonfeeding-grade Doxygen documentation. For when the deadline is not tomorrow.
