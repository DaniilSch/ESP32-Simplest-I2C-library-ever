# Simplest-I2C-library-ever-for-ESP32-
I2C master library for ESP32 written with MAXIMUM transparency, readability, ease of use and integration in mind. Full spoonfeeding-grade documentation is included. 

**Part of  "Simple Universal Solutions" (SUS) library pack.**   ;)

One .h file. No 3rd party #defines, #includes, typedefs and such. Because you have the right to use the code without the burden of learning the intricacies of author's code abstraction philosophy.

## Two versions of the same library are available:

 - **"BAREBONES Version"** - Just the core functions and bare minimum of documentation. For when you just want to copy-paste.
 - **"FULL version"** - All the functions (core+extra), full spoonfeeding-grade Doxygen documentation. For when the deadline is not tomorrow.
